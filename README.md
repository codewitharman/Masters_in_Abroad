# Abroad_Masters.java
In this project I have used concepts of core java like OOP's , constructor,scanner class etc.
In Masters in abroad project class Country is Genralised class and (Country names -USA,Germany etc, University, Masters course , Masters details ) this are specialised classes. In which I have used parameterised constructor to Initialise various parameters of my masters program details like Program name,Exams Require like (IELTS/CAT/GRE)  Program Fees, Scholarship availibility, University rank Globally, Masters program duration in years .
In my driver class which is class Msabroad.
In my main method I have used scanner class to get user input. To get user input form user for selecting Countries , Univeristies and Masters course in it.
I have used Switch method also. with the help of switch case user can choose input  to enter. and this is how I have used for all the countries present in my program
Now last part which is if user wants to stay on that page or not.
with the help of user input he can exit or if he wants to the he can choose another courses from various countries.
